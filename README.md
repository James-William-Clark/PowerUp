# PowerUp
A fitness tracker inspired by personal gym experiences and RPG games to track and measure strength, get motivated and optimise workout routines.

Users will earn experience points by completing workouts and making healthy life choices. Quests will be various workout challenges to motivate users to go outside their usual workout routines. For example, a user might get a weekly quest to run a total of 25km.

Experience points will increase the user's "PowerLevel" and user performance in weight lifting and cardio activities will derive their stats: strength, endurance and speed. These stats will be relative to the standards of the user's age and gender. Users will be able to select which stats they want to focus on and workout plans around that will be recommended.
