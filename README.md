# PowerUp
A fitness tracker inspired by personal gym experiences and RPG games to track and measure strength, get motivated and optimise workout routines.

Building this in React Native for cross platform support and gain experience in frameworks outside of what I use in the workplace.

Backend is intended to be NodeJs but features requiring a backend are low priority as I want the application to work without an internet connection.

Wishlist
- Integrate 5/3/1 progression into app
- Allow users to implement rules based progression systems e.g. increase rep/set/weight based on meeting certain lift objectives
- MyFitnessPal integration to have my diet tracking in the same place
- Compare my lifting maxes to strength standards for people in the same weight class
